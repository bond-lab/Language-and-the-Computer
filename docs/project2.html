<h1>LAC: Language and the Computer: Project 2</h1>


<p>This assignment constitutes 30% of your final grade
for <a href='index.html'>LAC</a>.  Please work on this in groups of
two or three.


<p>Pick one of the following:</p>


<h2>A: Consistency in Sentiment Lexicons (monolingual)</h2>

<p>You have been given some sentiment data from the NTU-MC corpus and a
  function to read in sentiment scores (between -1.0 and 1.0 in
  wordnet).  Compare it to word level sentiment lexicons from other
  projects (and those projects to each other).

<p>You can use the wordnet sentiment data from <a href='project1.html'>Project 1</a>.
  
 <p>There is a some scaffolding to help you get started with the
  English data: <a href='code/compare-senti.py'>compare-senti.py</a>
  (<a href='code/compare-senti.html'>formatted</a>, <a href='code/compare-senti-out.txt'>output</a>),
  and here is the data it
  needs <a href='code/en_senti.zip'>en_senti.zip</a>.  Put the
  data in the same directory as the program.  Please feel free to
   extend this (or start from scratch).
 <p>And here is the data individually:
   <ul>
   <li><a href='code/en_senti/DAL/DictionaryofAffect'>DAL</a>
   <li><a href='code/en_senti/AFINN/AFINN-111.txt'>AFINN</a>
   <li><a href='code/en_senti/GLASGOW/13428_2018_1099_MOESM2_ESM.csv'>GLAS</a>
   <li><a href='code/en_senti/VADER/vader_lexicon.txt'>VADER</a>
   </ul>
  <p>  
  
<h3>Minimal Requirements</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Compare at least three of these resources with each other and with
      the  NTU-MC corpus data.
      <ol>
      <li> <a href='https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn'>AFINN sentiment
	  data</a> Nielsen (2011)
	
       <li><a href='http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/papers/dict_of_affect/DictionaryofAffect'>Dictionary
	   of Affect in Language (DAL)</a> Whissel (2000)
	 <li><a href='https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.3758%2Fs13428-018-1099-3/MediaObjects/13428_2018_1099_MOESM2_ESM.csv'>Glasgow

	 <li><a
	 href='https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment'>Vader
	     Sentiment</a> C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert (2014)
 
      </ol>
    <li>How well do the lexicons compare in terms of consistency and
      coverage?
      <br>are there consistent differences?
    <li>How do they compare with the NTU-MC wordnet data?
    <li>Consider especially the problem of different senses having
    different sentiment: the Glasgow Norms have some data sense
    differentiated which may be useful for this.
  </ol>

  
  <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Try to merge the lexicons into one bigger, better lexicon,
    and explain why you think it is better
    <li> Find other lexicons to compare
    <li> Can the word level lexicons be used to extend the wordnet
      lexicon?   If so, how?
    <li> DAL and the Glasgow Norms have scores on other dimensions
    (such as Activation and Imagery) compare them as well 
    <li> Look at the effect of morphology (verb inflections,
    comparatives and superlatives, derivational linsk)
    <li> Show how you can extend/check the scores
  </ol>


<h2>B: Consistency in Sentiment Lexicons (multilingual)</h2>

<p> Look for sentiment lexicons in other languages, and use the
  multilingual wordnet to compare values.

<p>This is more difficult than <b>A</b> as you have to deal with translation shift
  as well as word/sense and resource quality issues.




<h2>C: Own Task</h2>

<p>You can suggest your own task, and if I say ok, do it instead.
  This can be used to fit in with other research you are doing, but
  should not duplicate work done for other assessment, you must do
  something new for this class.

  
  <h2>Deliverable</h2>
<p>You should deliver a paper, the program and the output files.
  
  <ul>
    <li>The paper should be no more than ten pages
including diagrams, with up to two additional pages of references,
  <li> You should give concrete examples from the resource(s) you
    analyzed.
  <li>Include quantitive results.
  <li>Include representative examples.
  <li> You don't need an extensive literature review, but you should
    read and cite  the references below and  if you
    consult other lexicons (which you are encouraged to do) then you
    should read the papers that describe them carefully, and cite them.
  <li>Formatted according to
    the LMS  guidelines</a> to submitting written work for the Division of LMS
    (but see below).
    <ul>
      <li>You do not have to follow the suggested structure of "Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References."  A short introduction describing the task followed by Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References is enough.
      <li>You should use single spacing, not double spacing.
    </ul>
    <li>Include your entire program (including internal
documentation) as an appendix: this does <b>not</b> count
  toward the ten page total.
  <br>In the main paper describe generally what the program does (no
  need to go into extreme detail)
  <li>If you want to make it even more beautiful, as I am sure you do,
    take a look at my <a href =
			 "http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/fcbond/data/ling-style.pdf">(Computational)
      Linguistic Style Guidelines</a>: a guide for the flummoxed.
  <li> Submit
    <!-- both <b>hardcopy</b> (stapled, single-spaced, two sided,  no folder, no cover page) and -->
    <b>softcopy</b> (via NTULearn). 
  <li> The deadline is on the main page.</b>.  
</ul>
