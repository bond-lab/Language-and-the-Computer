<h1>LAC: Language and the Computer: Project 2</h1>


<p>This assignment constitutes 30% of your final grade
for <a href='index.html'>LAC</a>.  Please work on this in groups of
two or three.


<p>Pick one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: Disambiguate the individual words in all (or some) MWEs in wordnet (★★)
    <ul>
      <li>For <i>machine translation</i> in English return:
	<br>  <tt>[("machine", Synset("machine.n.01")), 
	  ("translation", Synset("translation.n.01"))]</tt>
      <li>For <i>loose cannon</i>
	<tt>[("loose", None), ("cannon", None)]</tt>
      <li>Possibly also give "unsure" or a confidence score
    </ul>
  <li>B: Train and test a POS tagger for a new language (★)
    <ul>
      <li>Find a corpus (not from NLTK) with POS tags 
      <li>Read it in and convert it into a list of tuples <tt>(word, tag)</tt>
      <li>Divided it into train/dev/test
      <li>Train the best POS tagger that you can
      <li>Discuss which POS tags/words are hard and why
      <li>It could be that you find errors in the corpus: discuss how they could be fixed
      <li>Bonus: convert to Universal POS and see if the accuracy improves.
    </ul>
  <li>C:  Choose your own task of equivalent difficulty (★ - ★★★)
    <br>Some suggestions:
    <ul>
      <li> Find all examples of some phenomena in a corpus semi-automatically and analyze them
	<ul> 
	  <li>Reduplication
	  <li>Serial verb constructions
	  <li>Taboo words (try the massive Enron corpus)
	  <li>Productive affixes (<i>un-, -less, -ish</i>)
	</ul>
      <li> Identify loan words and their sources in the dictionary of a language
    </ul>
    <br>Check the task with me and I will let you know if I think it
    is too easy or too difficult.
</ul>


<h2>A: Disambiguating Multi-Word Expressions</h2>


<p>Multi-word expressions come in various types, from those where the
meaning is fully predictable from the individual words
(<b>compositional</b>: like <i>colour television</i>) to those where
knowing the individual words does not allow you to predict the meaning
(<b>non-compositional</b>: like <i>red head</i> "person with red hair").

<p>Write a program that takes a list of multi-word nouns (you can
expand to other parts-of-speech) from a dictionary and determines the
meaning (i.e. the synset) of the elements.  If it is compositional
(e.g. in English, is <i>N1 N2</i> an <i>N2</i>) you can get the
meaning of the head by looking at the hypernyms.  For other words, you
can try to disambiguate by looking at the definitions and examples: in
general, if you can find a close link, then that will be the right
meaning.  You can use the <i>wordnet gloss corpus</i> to get disambiguated definitions.

<p>This is a hard task --- for non-compositional words there will be
no good sense, and even for compositional words accuracy is typically
less than 70%.


<h2>B: Part of Speech Tagging</h2>

<p>This is a more straight-forward task.  Morphologically complex
languages are much harder, try to pick something relatively analytic.  

<p>NLTK has several POS taggers, you may want to try more than one and compare them.  

<p>If you have text from different genres, you may want to test the cross-domain accuracy.

  

<h2>C: Own Task</h2>

<p>You can suggest your own task, and if I say ok, do it instead.
  This can be used to fit in with other research you are doing, but
  should not duplicate work done for other assessment, you must do
  something new for this class.

  
  <h2>Deliverable</h2>
<p>You should deliver a paper, the program and the output files.
  
  <ul>
    <li>The paper should be no more than ten pages
including diagrams, with up to two additional pages of references,
  <li> You should give concrete examples from the resource(s) you
    analyzed.
  <li>Include quantitive results.
  <li>Include representative examples.
  <li> You don't need an extensive literature review, but you should
    read and cite  the references below and  if you
    consult other lexicons (which you are encouraged to do) then you
    should read the papers that describe them carefully, and cite them.
  <li>Include a link to your entire program on google colab --- I should be able to run the entire page
  <br>In the main paper describe generally what the program does (no
  need to go into extreme detail)
 <li>If you want to make it even more beautiful, as I am sure you do,
    take a look at my <a href =
			 "https://fcbond.github.io/static/img/ling-style.pdf">(Computational)
      Linguistic Style Guidelines</a>: a guide for the flummoxed.
  <li> Submit
    <b>softcopy</b> (via moodle). 
  <li> The deadline is on the main page.</b>.  
</ul>
