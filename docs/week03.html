      <h1>3. If Statements - LAC</h1>

      <h3>Lecture notes</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Read <i>Python Crash Course</i> Chapter 5
	<li><strong>Boolean</strong>  is something that is either “true” or “false” named after the English mathematician George Boole)
	  <br><code> checkme = True </code>
	  <br><code> checked = False </code>
	  <br><code> a == b</code>
	  <code> vocab.insert('another') </code>
	<li> Some more useful facts about Booleans
	  <ul>
	    <li> Most types have a value that evaluates to false
	      <br> <code>"", [], (), {}, …</code>
	      <br> You can take advantage of this to make programs easier to read
          </ul>
	<li> You can include a test in a list comrehension:
	  <br> <code>[fun(w) for w in V if p(w)]</code>
	<li><a href='pdf/cheat_sheet/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_if_while.pdf'>Cheat Sheet: if/while</a>,
	  <a href='pdf/cheat_sheet/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_if_while_bw.pdf'>Cheat Sheet: if/while&nbsp;BW</a>
	</ul>


<h3>Before class  (<a href='code/wk03a.html'>code</a>,
  <a href='code/wk03a-out.txt'>output</a>)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Print 5 python statements that evaluate to <code>True</code>
    and 5 to <code>False</code>.  Try to use different comparison operators (not just  <code>==</code> but also <code>!=, >,  …</code>
    <br>Format like this
    <br><code>print(f"1+1 == 2 {1+1 == 2}")</code>
  <li>Write code to check if <code>3</code> is in <code>range(0,3)</code>.
  <li>How can you change the range to include <code>3</code>?
  <li>  Write an if - elif - else chain that determines a person’s stage
of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:
<ul>
  <li> If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
  <li> If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
  <li> If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 8, print a message that the person is an infant.
  <li> If the person is at least 8 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a child.
  <li> If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
  <li> If the person is at least 20 years old, print a message that the person is an adult.
</ul>
</ul>

	<p>Some problems adapted from PCC 5-6

<h3>Practical work (<a href='code/wk03b.html'>code</a>,
  <a href='code/wk03b-out.txt'>output</a>)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make a tuple of  <code>person = (name, age)</code>
  <li>Adjust the code you wrote before class to print a personalized message based on the name and age:
    <br>e.g. Fanny is a baby: Sleep well!
    <br>e.g. Fran is a teenager: Enjoy School!
    <br>e.g. Francis is an adult: Work hard!


  
  <li> Take your guest list from last week, and change it to a list of
  tuples: <code>[(name, age), (name, age), …]</code>
    <ul>
      <li>use list comprehension to make a list of just the ages
      <li>use <code>sum()</code> and <code>len()</code> to find the
	average
      <li>Divide the guests into two groups, younger and older,
	depending on their age
      <li>Print the names of the youngest and oldest guests 

    </ul>
  <li>Czech numbers from 11 to 20 are semi-regularly derived from the numbers from 1 to 10. Loop through the numbers from 1 to 10 and print out that number and that plus 10.
    <br>e.g.: jeden - jedenact
   <code><pre> 
    čislo = ["jeden", "dva", "tři", "čtyři", "pět", "šest", "sedm", "osm", "devět", "deset"]
   </pre></code>
   use <code>if - elif - else</code> to construct the number plus 10

   <br>the teens are:  <code>["jedenáct", "dvanáct", "třináct", "čtrnáct", "patnáct", "šestnáct", "sedmnáct", "osmnáct", "devatenáct", "dvacet"]</code>
  <li> Here are some examples of  Onomatopoeia:
<code><pre>
data = [
    # Korean Onomatopoeia
    [
        ("개굴개굴", "gaegul-gaegul", "Ribbit (frog sound)"),
        ("멍멍", "meong-meong", "Woof (dog barking)"),
        ("야옹", "ya-ong", "Meow (cat sound)"),
        ("딸랑딸랑", "ddal-lang-ddal-lang", "Jingle (bell sound)"),
    ],
    
    # Chinese Onomatopoeia
    [
        ("汪汪", "wāng wāng", "Woof (dog barking)"),
        ("喵喵", "miāo miāo", "Meow (cat sound)"),
        ("哗啦啦", "huā lā lā", "Splash (water flowing)"),
    ],
    
    # Vietnamese Onomatopoeia
    [
        ("meo meo", "", "Meow (cat sound)"),
        ("gâu gâu", "", "Woof (dog barking)"),
        ("ục ịch", "", "Splash (water or something heavy dropping in water)"),
        ("ro ro", "", "Purr (cat sound)"),
    ],
    
    # Indonesian Onomatopoeia
    [
        ("guk guk", "", "Woof (dog barking)"),
        ("meong", "", "Meow (cat sound)"),
        ("kring kring", "", "Ring (phone or bell sound)"),
    ],
    # Japanese Onomatopoeia
    [
        ("ワンワン", "wan wan", "Woof (dog barking)"),
        ("ニャーニャー", "nyaa nyaa", "Meow (cat sound)"),
        ("ピヨピヨ", "piyo piyo", "Tweet (bird chirping)"),
        ("ゴロゴロ", "goro goro", "Purring (cat purr) / Rolling"),
    ]
    ]
</pre></code>
<ul>
  <li>print just the Korean list
  <li>Make a new list of lists,
    with the sub-lists having the transliteration, if it exists, if not then the words
 </ul>  
</ul>


<p> Some problems adapted from PCC 5-11.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li> You learned how to write conditional tests, which always
    evaluate to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>
  <li> You learned about some of the different ways that you can test
    <br>  <code>==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, element in list, … </code>
  <li> You learned to test with <code>if - elif - else</code>
  <li> You learned to handle certain items in a list differently
</ul>
