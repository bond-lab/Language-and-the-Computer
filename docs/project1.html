<h1>LAC: Language and the Computer</h1>


<h2>Project 1: Japanese names</h2>

<p>This project constitutes 30% of your final grade
for <a href='index.html'>LAC</a>.  Please work on the final
program and report individually.

<p>You will be given some name data from the website
  <a href='https://www.namaejiten.com/'>Heisei Namae Jiten</a> and use the
  <a href='https://github.com/neocl/jamdict'>jamdict module</a> for accessing Jim Breen's kanjidic.

  
<p>There is a some scaffolding to help you get started: Here is the
  code in collab: <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h0FmMEErb4saEgT_d_OCARcyPKHWo30D?usp=sharing'>2024-project1.ipynb</a>, and here is the data you
  needs <a href='names.tsv'>names.tsv</a>.   Please feel free to extend
  this or start from scratch as you prefer.

<p><tt>names.tsv</tt> has the following columns:
  <pre>
type    year    rank    name     frequency
boy     1       1       翔太     4639
</pre>
<p>Where type is one of <tt>boy/girl/name</tt> for boy's name, girl's
name, full name.  Year is the year of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisei_era'>Heisei Era</a> (year 1 is from 8
January 1989, year 21 is to 30 April 2019).
  
    
  <h3>Minimal Requirements</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Measure the average number of stroke counts
      <ol>
	<li>For full names
	<li>For first names
	<li>For last names
      </ol>
      Make sure you do something for hiragana
    <li>Are first names or last names more complicated (i.e. have more strokes)
      <br>Is this difference significant?
  </ol>

<p>The data is sorted by year, and we know the names of boys and girls.
  
  <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Look at differences between boys and girls.
    <li>Look at differences between years (don't forget to normalize
    for frequency: there may be different totals for different
    years).
    <li>Are some stroke counts more popular than others?
    <li>Do people with complicated surnames tend to have simpler first
    names or not?
  </ol>
  
<h3>Write up</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The paper should be up to six pages, include a title, date and name on the first page, you do not need a separate title page.
    <li>The paper should be single spaced.
  <li> In the write up you should describe what you found out about the names
  <li> You should give concrete examples from the resource you
    analyzed.
  <li>Include quantitive results.
  <li>Include representative examples.
  <li>Link to your program in coogle colab: this does <b>not</b> count
  toward the six page total.
  <br>In the main paper describe generally what the program does (no
  need to go into extreme detail)
  <li>If you want to make it even more beautiful, as I am sure you do,
    take a look at my <a href =
			 "https://fcbond.github.io/static/img/ling-style.pdf">(Computational)
      Linguistic Style Guidelines</a>: a guide for the flummoxed.
  <li> Submit
    <!-- both <b>hardcopy</b> (stapled, single-spaced, two sided,  no folder, no cover page) and -->
    <b>softcopy</b> (via NTULearn). 
  <li> The deadline is on the main page.</b>.
