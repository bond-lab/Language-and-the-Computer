<h1>LAC: Language and the Computer: Project 3</h1>
<h2>In-Class On-Line Open-Book Programming Challenge</h2>

<p>This assignment constitutes 30% of your final grade
for <a href='index.html'>LAC</a>. 

<h2>Multilingual Analysis of Names</h2>

<p>The website Listophile has a page of <a href='https://listophile.com/names/nationality/'>Names by Nationality</a>.
  I have downloaded the names, and the nationality names, into two files, formatted using TOML (TOML: Tom's Obvious Minimal Language):
  <ul>
    <li> <a href='code/names-listophile-desc.toml'>names-listophile-desc.toml</a>
    <li> <a href='code/names-listophile.toml'>names-listophile.toml</a> 
  </ul>
  
<p>Read in the files, and investigate the names:

  <ol>
    <li>How many nationalities are there?
    <li>How many names are there for each nationality?
       <br>Give examples
    <li>How many names are ambiguous between genders for each language:
      <br>Give examples
    <li>Learn a gender classifier for each nationality:
      <ul>
	<li>What are the most useful features for each language?
	<li>What are the most useful features for all languages?
	<li>Are names in some languages more sharply distinguished than others?
      </ul>
    <li>Two languages (Korean and Chinese) have the names in multiple scripts
      <ul>
	<li>Train classifiers for each script
      </ul>
    <li>The names are given with descriptors: <i>Francis</i> "Free man"
      <ul>
	<li> Are the descriptors consistent across languages?
	<li> Can you predict gender from the descriptors?
	  <br> Even if you take out 'man', 'woman'?
      </ul>
  </ol>


<h4>Deliverables</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Per person:
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 page paper in any format, finally given as pdf, 
	describing what you have done, and
	what you think could be done given more time. 
	<br>Include <b>title, author, date</b>
	e.g.
	<center>
	  LAC Project 3: Multilingual Analysis of Names
	  <br>Francis Bond 
	  <br>2021-11-11
	</center>
	
	<br>The file should be named <tt>name_surname_matric.pdf</tt>
	<br>e.g. <tt>francis_bond_007.pdf</tt>
	<br>you do not need full citations, this is just a short summary
	<br>don't include the program as an appendix (you submit it separately)
      <li>program 
	<br>The program should be in a google colab
	<br>Include the URL in the paper
    </ul>
  <li>Upload them to moodle
    <br>If you <b>don't</b> want me to show off your
    code/output/paper, please let me know within a month
</ul>

  
<h3>Pedagogical Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Consolidate skills in a novel task under realistic conditions
  <li> Demonstrate an ability to break a task into small chunks
    <br>Should be able to consider and evaluate multiple approaches
  <li> Demonstrate an ability to use python to solve tasks
    <br>choosing the write approach, writing and debugging
  <li> Demonstrate an ability to cooperate to solve a problem
    <br>good communication, delivering (partial) results in time
</ul>
