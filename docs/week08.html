<h3>Before Class (<a href='code/wk8a.html'>code</a>)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Convert the following <tt>for</tt> loop into a <tt>while</tt> loop (which does the same thing as the
<tt>for</tt> loop):
<pre>
for i in range(1,10,2):
      print "i = ", i
</pre>
Be careful about the start and end conditions.
<li> Translate the following <tt>while</tt> loop into a <tt>for</tt> loop 
(which does the same thing as the <tt>while</tt> loop):
<pre>
i = 20
while (i > 0):
      print "i = ", i
      i -= 1
</pre>
Be careful about the start and end conditions.

<li>When empty strings and empty lists occur in the condition part of
an <b>if</b> clause, they evaluate to <tt>False</tt>. In this case,
they are said to be occurring in a Boolean context. Experiment with
different kind of non-Boolean expressions in Boolean contexts, and see
whether they evaluate as <tt>True</tt> or <tt>False</tt>.
</ul>

<h3>Practical work (<a href='code/wk8b.html'>code</a>)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write a function <tt>shorten(text, n)</tt> to process a text,
omitting the <tt>n</tt> most frequently occurring words of the text. How
readable is it?

<li>Write a list comprehension that sorts a list of WordNet synsets
for proximity to a given synset. For example, given the synsets
<tt>minke_whale.n.01, orca.n.01, novel.n.01, and tortoise.n.01</tt>, sort them
according to their <tt>shortest_path_distance()</tt> from <tt>right_whale.n.01</tt>

<li>Write a function that takes a list of words (containing
duplicates) and returns a list of words (with no duplicates) sorted by
decreasing frequency. E.g. if the input list contained 10 instances of
the word <i>table</i> and 9 instances of the word <i>chair</i>, then <i>table</i> would
appear before <i>chair</i> in the output list.

<li>Write some code to sort words by length. 
Use a key that gives the length of the word. 
(<b>Note</b>: you must have read <a href="https://www.nltk.org/book/ch04.html#doing-more-with-functions">4.5 Doing more with Functions</a>)

<!-- <li>Given the following sentence represented as a list of word, -->
<!-- concept tuples; write two programs: one to replace the words with the -->
<!-- most frequent lemmas, one with the least frequent. -->
