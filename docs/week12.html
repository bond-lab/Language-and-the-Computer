<h1>12. Summary and Review</h1>

<p>For revision: reread chapters 1-6, redo the tutorial problems.


<h2>NLTK Chapters: 1-6</h2>


<h3>Sequences</h3>
<ol>
   <li> Strings, lists and tuples are different kinds of sequence
     object, supporting common operations such as indexing, slicing,
     finding the length, sorting, and membership testing using <code>in</code>.

  </li><li> Texts can be represented in Python using lists: ['Monty', 
'Python']. We can use indexing, slicing, and the len() function on 
lists.
    <ul>
      <li><code>list  = ['Monty', 'Python']</code>
      </li><li><code>list[0] = 'Monty'</code>
      </li><li><code>list[0:1] = ['Monty']</code>
      </li><li><code>len(list) = 2</code>
    </li></ul>
 </li><li> A string is specified in Python using single or double quotes: 
   'Monty Python', "Monty Python".
    <ul>
      <li><code>string = "string"</code>
      </li><li><code>string[0] = "s"</code>
      </li><li><code>string[1:3] = "rin"</code>
      </li><li><code>len(string) = 5</code>
    </li></ul>
 </li><li> Strings have some special tests associated with them:
    <ul>
      <li><code>string.startswith('substr')</code>
      </li><li><code>string.endswith('substr')</code>
      </li><li><code>string.isalpha()</code>
      </li><li><code>string.islower()</code>
      </li><li><code>string.istitle()</code>
      </li><li><code>string.isupper()</code>
    </li></ul>
 </li><li> Strings can be split into lists: <code>'Monty Python'.split()</code> gives 
   <code>['Monty', 'Python']</code>.
 </li><li> Lists can be joined into strings: <code>'/'.join(['Monty', 'Python'])</code> gives 
    <code>'Monty/Python'</code>.
  </li><li> A dictionary is used to map between arbitrary types of
  information, such as a string and a number: 
    <br> <code>freq['cat'] = 12</code>. 
  </li><li> We create dictionaries using the brace notation: 
    <br> <code>pos = {}</code> 
    <br> <code>pos = {'furiously': 'adv', 'ideas': 'n', 'colorless': 'adj'}</code>

  </li><li> A  tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas:
    <br> <code> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'</code>

  </li><li> Tuples are normally enclosed in parentheses <code>()</code>

  </li><li> List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. The
    resulting list definition tends often to be clearer than lists built
    using those constructs. Each list comprehension consists of an
    expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if
    clauses. The result will be a list resulting from evaluating the
    expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow
    it. If the expression would evaluate to a tuple, it must be
    parenthesized.
    <br>to get nouns from a tagged corpus: <code>nouns = [ w for (w, t) in tagged_text if t.startswith('N')]</code>

  </li><li> A string formatting expression template % arg_tuple consists of
  a format string template that contains conversion specifiers like
  %-6s and %0.2d.
    <br> <code> print "Tokens = %d; Types = %d; Tokens/Type = %0.2d" % 
      (len(words), len(set(words), 1.0*len(words)/len(set(words)))</code>
</li></ol>

<h3>Control and Program Style</h3>
<ol>
  <li> We process each word in a text using a for statement, such
  as <code>for w in t:</code> or <code>for word in text:</code>. This must be
  followed by the colon character and an indented block of code, to be
  executed each time through the loop.

  </li><li> We can also loop through things using a while loop.
    <br><code>while (n != 20):</code>

  </li><li> We can also do this in a single command (a <i>list
  comprehension</i>).  To derive the vocabulary, collapsing case
  distinctions and ignoring punctuation, we can
  write <code>set([w.lower() for w in text if w.isalpha()])</code>.


  </li><li> We test a condition using an if statement: <code>if len(word) &lt;
  5:</code>. This must be followed by the colon character and an indented
  block of code, to be executed only if the condition is true.


  </li><li> A function is a block of code that has been assigned a name and
  can be reused. Functions are defined using the <code>def</code> keyword,
  as in <code>def mult(x, y)</code>; x and y are parameters of the function,
  and act as placeholders for actual data values.

  </li><li> A function is called by specifying its name followed by one or
  more arguments inside parentheses, like this: <code>mult(3, 4)</code>,
  e.g., <code>len(text1)</code>.


  </li><li> Python programs more than a few lines long should be entered
  using a text editor, saved to a file with a <code>.py</code> extension,
  and accessed using an import statement.

  </li><li> Python functions permit you to associate a name with a
  particular block of code, and re-use that code as often as
  necessary.

  </li><li> A function serves as a namespace: names defined inside a
  function are not visible outside that function, unless those names
  are declared to be global.


<!--   <li> Some functions, known as "methods", are associated with an -->
<!--   object and we give the object name followed by a period followed by -->
<!--   the function, like this:<code> x.funct(y)</code>, -->
<!--   e.g., <code>word.isalpha()</code>. -->

  </li><li> Some functions are not available by default, but must be
  accessed using Python's import<code></code> statement.

  </li><li> To find out about some variable v, type <code>help(v)</code> in the
  Python interactive interpreter to read the help entry for this kind
  of object.

  </li><li> Python's assignment and parameter passing use object
  references; e.g. if <code>a</code> is a list and we assign <code>b = a</code>, then any
  operation on <code>a</code> will modify <code>b</code>, and vice versa.

  </li><li> The <code>is</code> operation tests if two objects are identical internal
  objects, while <code>==</code> tests if two objects are equivalent. This
  distinction parallels the type-token distinction.

  </li><li> It is good to test functions with specialized test data (unit tests) to check that they work.
    <br> To test <code>+</code> we make some data <code>test = [(1, 1,
      2), (1, 0, 1), (2, 2, 4)]</code>
    <code>
    <pre> for (a, b,c ) in test:
	if (a + b != c):
		print "test failed: %s + %s not equal to %s" % (a, b, c) 
    </pre></code>

<!--   <li> A declarative programming style usually produces more compact, -->
<!--   readable code; manually-incremented loop variables are usually -->
<!--   unnecessary; when a sequence must be enumerated, use enumerate(). -->

<!--   <li> Functions are an essential programming abstraction: key -->
<!--   concepts to understand are parameter passing, variable scope, and -->
<!--   docstrings. -->

 
</li></ol>

<h3>Lexical Resources</h3>
<ol>
  <li> A word "token" is a particular appearance of a given word in a 
text; a word "type" is the unique form of the word as a particular 
sequence of letters. We count word tokens using <code>len(text)</code> and word types using <code>len(set(text))</code>.

  </li><li> We obtain the vocabulary of a text t using <code>sorted(set(t))</code>.

  </li><li> We operate on each item of a text using <code>[f(x) for x in text]</code>.

  </li><li> A frequency distribution is a collection of items along with
 their frequency counts (e.g., the words of a text and their frequency 
of appearance).

  </li><li> A text corpus is a large, structured collection of texts. NLTK
  comes with many corpora, e.g., the Brown
  Corpus, <code>nltk.corpus.brown</code>.

  </li><li> Often you can access many views:
    <ul>
      <li>  <code>nltk.corpus.brown.raw</code> the whole corpus as one string
      </li><li>  <code>nltk.corpus.brown.words</code> the whole corpus tokenized into words
      </li><li>  <code>nltk.corpus.brown.sents</code> the whole corpus tokenized into words and split into sentences
      </li><li>  <code>nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words</code>  the whole corpus tokenized and tagged
      </li><li>  <code>nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_sents</code>  the whole corpus tokenized and tagged and split into sents
    </li></ul>

  </li><li> Some text corpora are categorized, e.g., by genre or topic;
  sometimes the categories of a corpus overlap each other.

  </li><li> A conditional frequency distribution is a collection of
  frequency distributions, each one for a different condition. They
  can be used for counting word frequencies, given a context or a
  genre.

  </li><li> WordNet is a semantically-oriented dictionary of English,
  consisting of synonym sets or synsets and organized into a network.
</li></ol>

<h3>Dealing with raw text</h3>

<ol>
  <li> In this book we view a text as a list of words. A "raw text" is
  a potentially long string containing words and whitespace
  formatting, and is how we typically store and visualize a text.

  </li><li> We can read text from a file <code>f</code> using<code> text = open(f).read()</code>. 

  </li><li> We can read text from a URL <code>u</code> using <code>text = urlopen(u).read()</code>. 

  </li><li> We can write text to a file by opening the file for writing:
    <code>file = open('output.txt', 'w')</code>, then adding content to the file:
    <code>file.write("Monty Python")</code>, and finally closing the file:
    <code>file.close()</code>.


  </li><li> We can iterate over the lines of a text file using <code>for line in open(f):</code>.

  </li><li> Texts found on the web may contain unwanted material (such as
  headers, footers, markup), that need to be removed before we do any
  linguistic processing.

 
  </li><li> Tokenization is the segmentation of a text into basic units or
  tokens such as words and punctuation. Tokenization based on
  whitespace is inadequate for many applications because it bundles
  punctuation together with words. NLTK provides an off-the-shelf
  tokenizer <code>nltk.word_tokenize()</code>.

  </li><li> Lemmatization is a process that maps the various forms of a
  word (such as <i>appeared, appears</i>) to the canonical or citation form
  of the word, also known as the lexeme or lemma (e.g. <code><i>appear</i></code>).
</li></ol>

<h3><a name='regexp'>Regular Expressions</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li> Regular expressions are a powerful and flexible method of
  specifying patterns. Once we have imported the re module, we can use
  <code>re.findall()</code> to find all substrings in a string that match a
  pattern.

  </li><li> If a regular expression string includes a backslash, you should
  tell Python not to preprocess the string, by using a raw string with
  an <code>r</code> prefix: <code>r'regexp'</code>.

 </li><li>Regular expressions use meta-characters: <code> . ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \ | ( )</code>

  </li><li> When backslash is used before certain characters,
  e.g. <code>\n</code>, this takes on a special meaning (newline character);
  however, when backslash is used before regular expression wildcards
  and operators, e.g. <code>\.</code>, <code>\|</code>, <code>\$</code>, these
  characters lose their special meaning and are matched literally.

  </li><li> Regular expressions can be used to discover knowledge through patterns in text:
    <br><code>「([non-ascii]+)」\(([ \w]+)\)</code> finds translation pairs 
    <br> 「<u>自然言語処理</u> 」(<u>natural language processing</u>)
    <br><code>\b(\w+) such as (w+)</code> finds hypernym-hyponyms
    <br> <u>animals</u> such as <u>cats,</u> dogs and raccoons
  <li>We can match and then see what we matched
    <pre>
      m=re.match(pattern, string)
      if m:
          print ('Match found: ', m.group())
      </pre>
</ol>

<h3>Tagging and Classification</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Words can be grouped into classes, such as nouns, verbs,
  adjectives, and adverbs. These classes are known as lexical
  categories or parts of speech. Parts of speech are assigned short
  labels, or tags, such as NN, VB,

  </li><li> The process of automatically assigning parts of speech to words
  in text is called part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or just
  tagging.

  </li><li> Automatic tagging is an important step in the NLP pipeline, and
  is useful in a variety of situations including: predicting the
  behavior of previously unseen words, analyzing word usage in
  corpora, and text-to-speech systems.

  </li><li> Some linguistic corpora, such as the Brown Corpus, have been
  POS tagged.

  </li><li> A variety of tagging methods are possible, e.g. default tagger,
  regular expression tagger, unigram tagger and n-gram taggers. These
  can be combined using a technique known as backoff.

  </li><li> Taggers can be trained and evaluated using tagged corpora.
  Useful features include:
    <ul>
      <li>Tag Frequency
      <li>Context: previous word or tag
      <li>Word Shape: prefix, suffix, capitalization, character type
    </ul>

  </li><li> Backoff is a method for combining models: when a more
  specialized model (such as a bigram tagger) cannot assign a tag in a
  given context, we backoff to a more general model (such as a unigram
  tagger).

  </li><li> Part-of-speech tagging is an important, early example of a
  sequence classification task in NLP: a classification decision at
  any one point in the sequence makes use of words and tags in the
  local context.


  </li><li> N-gram taggers can be defined for large values of n, but once n
  is larger than 3 we usually encounter the sparse data problem; even
  with a large quantity of training data we only see a tiny fraction
  of possible contexts.

  </li><li> Modeling the linguistic data found in corpora can help us to
  understand linguistic patterns, and can be used to make predictions
  about new language data.

  </li><li> Supervised classifiers use labeled training corpora to build
  models that predict the label of an input based on specific features
  of that input.

  </li><li> Supervised classifiers can perform a wide variety of NLP tasks,
  including document classification, part-of-speech tagging, sentence
  segmentation, dialogue act type identification, and determining
  entailment relations, and many other tasks.

  </li><li> Decision trees are automatically constructed tree-structured
  flowcharts that are used to assign labels to input values based on
  their features. Although they're easy to interpret, they are not
  very good at handling cases where feature values interact in
  determining the proper label.

 <!--  <li> In naive Bayes classifiers, each feature independently -->
<!--   contributes to the decision of which label should be used. This -->
<!--   allows feature values to interact, but can be problematic when two -->
<!--   or more features are highly correlated with one another. -->

<!--   <li> Maximum Entropy classifiers use a basic model that is similar -->
<!--   to the model used by naive Bayes; however, they employ iterative -->
<!--   optimization to find the set of feature weights that maximizes the -->
<!--   probability of the training set. -->

  </li><li> Most of the models that are automatically constructed from a
  corpus are descriptive they let us know which features are relevant
  to a given patterns or construction, but they don't give any
  information about causal relationships between those features and
  patterns.

<h3>Empirical Linguistics and Language Engineering</h3>

<ol>
  <li> It is important to evaluate your results against (i) a baseline
  and if possible (ii) a gold standard.
    <ul>
      <li> The standard baseline for most tagging tasks is MFT (most
	frequent tag), equivalent to the unigram tagger. 
	
      </li><li> The equivalent baseline for Word Sense Disambiguation is
	normally called <i>first sense</i>, as senses are normally ordered
	with the most salient (≈ most frequent) first.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li> We normally have to trade off recall (coverage) vs precision (accuracy).
    <br> We can get more results OR better ones.

  </li><li> When training a supervised classifier, you should split your
  corpus into three datasets: a <u>training set</u> for building the
  classifier model; a <u>dev-test</u> set for helping select and tune
  the model's features; and a <u>test set</u> for evaluating the final
  model's performance.

  </li><li> When evaluating a supervised classifier, it is important that
  you use fresh (unseen) data, that was not included in the training or
  dev-test set. Otherwise, your evaluation results may be
  unrealistically optimistic.

<!-- <h3>Sample Question</h3> -->

<!-- <p> The exam consists of 5 questions, with many sub-questions. -->

<!-- <p>Answers don't have to be perfect, do the best you can: better to sketch an outline than do nothing. -->

<!-- </p><h3>Question X: Tuples </h3> -->

<!-- <p>This question tests your understanding of tuples.  Remember you -->
<!-- will not be marked down for small errors in syntax or typos, so long -->
<!-- as you demonstrate that you understand how tuples work in python. -->

<!-- </p><p>(0) What is the value of <code>('Speaking', 'VBG', 'speak')[2]</code>?  -->
<!--   </p><pre>    'speak' -->
<!--   </pre> -->
<!-- <p>(1) You have a list of words: <code>sent = ['Hello', 'there',  'Prof']</code> -->
<!--   Write some code to make a list of tuples, where the first element is  -->
<!-- the word, and the second element is the word in lowercase. -->
<!-- </p><pre>  new = [(w, w.lower()) for w in sent] -->
<!-- </pre> -->
<!-- <p>(2) You have a tagged corpus, consisting of a list of (word, pos)  -->
<!-- tuples, and a function lemmatize, that takes a word and part of speech  -->
<!-- and returns the lemma. -->
<!--   Show how you can make a new corpus consisting of (word, lemma, pos)  -->
<!-- tuples. -->
<!-- </p><pre>  [(w, lemmatize(w,p), p) for (w,p) in tagged] -->
<!-- </pre> -->
<!-- <p>(3) Write a function that takes a list of words and -->
<!-- returns a list of tuples consisting of a word type and its frequency, -->
<!-- sorted by the frequency, with the most frequent first. -->
<!-- </p><pre>   -->
<!--   def FreqDist(words): -->
<!--       dist = sorted([(words.count(w), w) for w in set(words)], reverse=True)  -->
<!--       return [(w,c) for (c, w) in dist] -->

<!-- OR -->

<!--   def FreqDist(words): -->
<!--       dist = sorted([(-words.count(w), w) for w in set(words)])  -->
<!--       return [(w,-c) for (c, w) in dist] -->

<!-- OR -->
 
<!--   def FreqDist(words): -->
<!--       dist = sorted([(words.count(w), w) for w in set(words)]).reverse()  -->
<!--       return [(w,c) for (c, w) in dist] -->
<!-- </pre> -->
<!-- <p>Note: lists of tuples are sorted according to their first member, -->
<!-- numbers are sorted smallest to largest. -->
